# CSGO-Syntax-Sublime-Text
CSGO Syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3

## About
If you find any problems with the package or got any suggestions please open an issue [here](https://github.com/kvishno/CSGO-Syntax-Sublime-Text/issues) (contributions are also more than welcome). Some Cvars might be missing as they are updated all the time. 

This package will also have basic compatibility with other source games, but highlighting might not be perfect as Cvars are different.

## Installation
* Place files in `\..\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages\User` and pick CSGO.cfg as syntax under View
* Alternatively install [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev), place the [csgo_syntax.YAML-tmLanguage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvishno/CSGO-Syntax-Sublime-Text/master/csgo_syntax.YAML-tmLanguage) file in `\..\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages\User`, then open the file in Sublime and press F7 to build
